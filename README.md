_JUNE 2003 - MARCH 2007_  
I managed a handful of freelance writers and photographers, oversaw small projects, wrote article copy and made programming decisions. I learned the AP writing style and basic journalism skills. My unique combination of technical and editorial experience led to a role as an editorial liaison to product development. I advocated for both the AOL members and AOL employees who would be using the software. I officially joined product development (in New York) in September 2006 to plan future products. This included designing data models and user interfaces, writing specifications and assisting development throughout implementation and QA.
